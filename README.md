**USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**

The core of this package is the `NestreApiManager` class, a singleton that centralizes all HTTP requests to the Nestre API endpoints. It handles setting the base URL, authentication tokens, and includes a generic request handler with built-in error handling.

After initialization, each API endpoint is available under a separate public object. For example, the `User` portion of the API is accessed via the `userApi` object.

â–¶ **Initialization & Usage**
Step 1: Get the singleton instance and configure it.

```
import { NestreApiManager } from 'web-nestre-api';

// Get the singleton instance
const nestreApiManager = NestreApiManager.GetInstance();

// Set the base URL and authentication token
nestreApiManager.SetBaseUrl('https://api.yourserver.com');
nestreApiManager.SetAuthToken('your_jwt_token');

// Now you can access the API modules
const userApi = nestreApiManager.userApi;
```

Step 2: Use an API method, for example, to get a user profile.

```
// ... after initialization
async function getUserProfile(userId) {
  try {
    const userProfile = await userApi.GetBasicUserProfile(userId);
    console.log('User Profile:', userProfile);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user profile:', error.message);
  }
}

getUserProfile('your_user_id');
```

**DEPENDENCIES**

This package relies on other open-source packages to function correctly, such as Jest for testing and MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking API responses during development.
